# Welcome to N0ctOS !

Hi ! I am **N0ctane**, with my team. This project is an *open source* project currently ***under active developement***... (roadmap link)


# About the Project:
#### Philosophy :
This is an ***Simplified, Opinionated ARCH Linux Experience***, which **targets** *Developers, New Arch/Linux users, Daily driving linux users, or* **those who dont wanna rice from start.**
It is a pre-configured *Arch + Hyprland* setup, with additional custom scripts, utilities, and bunch of more stuff...

It aims to make Arch more accessible and UX friendly for just casual users, by providing some features...

 <details><summary><b>ISO install</b></summary>no minimal arch required. We set everything up for your ease...</details>
 <details><summary><b>Very Small ISO</b></summary>We will use an installation process which will be broken into 3 pieces. Not like 6-7gb of a ISO</details>
 <details><summary><b>Partial Storage Device Installation</b></summary>Many of Arch/Linux distros wants a full storage device to format for simplicity. But it losts the ability to let users Dual boot with any other OS... But we will add a simple way to do Dual booting via *Unallocated Space Trail Detection*, which will detect all Unallocated Space Chains/trails and will prompt the user to select one to install</details>
 <details><summary><b>Direct dotfiles install</b></summary>wanna take the dotfiles ? We will provide the dot-install script to only install the dotfiles...</details>
 <details><summary><b>Modular components</b></summary>most of the components used in this project will be modular. That means some one can even only install a specific thing of project, example- only the waybar</details>
 <details><summary><b>Pre-installed & configured apps & utils</b></summary>We will be adding some of the mainstream apps or hidden apps, that makes life easy on ARCH !!</details>
 <details><summary><b>User customizable</b></summary>Yeah it is opinionated linux, but we still leave a space for your opinion.. we got you !!</details>
 <details><summary><b>Own Bash util scripts</b></summary>These help the system bug free and more fun to use. BTW, u can take some of these for your system, nothing will break !!!</details>
 <details><summary><b>Support !!!</b></summary>On discord, Github Issues, Reddit etc (not setup yet)</details>
 <details><summary><b>Hand written Docs, for the nerdy ones</b></summary>Wanna dive deeper to N0ctOS's architecture ?? We have official docs [here(link will be put when available)]</details>
 <b>AND MUCH MORE TO COME !!!</b>
 
 ## What will you get ??
 
 - Hassle-free Pre-configured ARCH+HYPRLAND setup
 - Useful TUIs(Terminal User Interface) and GUIs(apps basically)
 - System Configurator Apps (settings, usually there is no settings app)
 - ASAP community support & well curated Docs for help
 
 ## What is different ? Why another distro/linux-setup ?
 See, configuring Arch is a joy in itself, but MAN !! it is HELL !!! it takes so much time to make a perfect rice... So, even if u are not a beginner, **you can use this setup as a base, for your next rice** (as this has some quality of life utility scripts that will save a lot of time while ricing... See __[the link to rice docs]__)
 
 ## Whom it targets ??
 
 It is mainly a flexible linux setup... but mostly ideal for **Developers**, **Daily-drivers** (casual users), **Casual gamers** (not for gaming, straight up... games like minecraft are ok) and of course,  **Beginners**
 
 ## Installation / Ricing / Contributing
 
 See the docs [**here**]
 
 ## Wanna redistribute something from this project ??
 Ok here is the ineteresting part..
 **You can redistribute anything you want.**
 Yes !! Anything, Anywhere, Anytime
 but, **plz follow these rules:**
 1. **Always fork the repo** of the thing you are redistributing (if there is any) , this helps us know which package/software is used by community the most. So that we can focus on maintaining that specific package more
