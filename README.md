# Welcome to N0ctOS !

Hi ! I am **N0ctane**, with my team. This project is an *open source* project currently ***under active developement***... (roadmap link)


# About the Project:

This is an ***Simplified, Opinionated ARCH Linux Experience***, which **targets** *Developers, New Arch/Linux users, Daily driving linux users, or* **those who dont wanna rice from start.**
It is a pre-configured *Arch + Hyprland* setup, with additional custom scripts, utilities, and bunch of more stuff...

It aims to make Arch more accessible and UX friendly for just casual users, by providing some features...

 - **ISO install :**  no minimal arch required. We set everything up for your ease...
 - **Direct dotfiles install :** wanna take the dotfiles ? We will provide the dot-install script to only install the dotfiles...
 - **Modular components :** most of the components used in this project will be modular. That means some one can even only install a specific thing of project, example- only the waybar
 - ***Pre-installed & configured apps & utils :*** We will be adding some of the mainstream apps or hidden apps, that makes life easy on ARCH !!
 - ***Partial Storage Device Installation :*** <details>
 <summary>More Details</summary>
 Many of Arch/Linux distros wants a full storage device to format for simplicity. But it losts the ability to let users Dual boot with any other OS... But we will add a simple way to do Dual booting via *Unallocated Space Trail Detection*, which will detect all Unallocated Space Chains/trails and will prompt the user to select one to install
